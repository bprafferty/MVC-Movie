# MVC-Movies
Full stack web application powered by C# and the ASP.NET framework. Utilizes SQLite database and supports all CRUD operations.

This web app implements the MVC schema to provide the services of a movie rental company. The front end was designed in CSHTML with CSS bootstraps, and the data was stored on the back end with a SQLite database to handle dynamic updates and data migrations. Once the data was stored, the layout and functionality of the movie application was added by giving users the ability to do CRUD operations. A user can view the selection of movies, filter the movies by title and genre, read specific information on a selected movie, add a new movie to the database, update the information describing a movie, and delete a movie from the database. 

To run this, first install Visual Studio, and install the ASP.NET dependencies.

Next, open this project in VS and run!
